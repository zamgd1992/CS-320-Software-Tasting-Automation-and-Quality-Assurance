This project had me dive in to testing software. I had always tested my code to make sure that it worked.
The problem is just making sure the code does what you want it to do is not sufficient.
Testing in a more formal way with tangible proof that the program does what it is supposed to is a much better way to prove that something works.
In this particular project, JUnit testing is used to better prove that the software does what it is supposed to.&nbsp;
Testing is way to help make sure that the program meets client needs and maintains a particular quality.
In this project tests were made for each of the needs outlined for the user of the program.
Writing code to meet these testing requirements helped create better code.
All code that I write should have quality behind it.&nbsp;
Testing not only helps fulfill the requirements or user needs it also helps ensure that a program is secure.
It is not possible to test every possibility that can be input into a system.
Good testing will test the most possible inputs as well as the boundaries of a given parameter.
It will also test that certain inputs will not be accepted by the program.
Making sure that invalid inputs are rejected will help with security and functionality.
Testing is another tool we have to create quality software that is secure and fulfills the requirements of the design.
